1. The interfaces between contracts is broken. I suspect it might have to do with the data
type that's being passed to the contracts, i.e. should be a string instead of an address.

2. when fakefullfilbytes() in offchainparkingdataresponse.sol is called,  the mapping between addresses
and bytes is not updated. This one I'm less sure as to why it's broken, but check the function in detail.

Additionally, I suspect the broke fakefulfillbytes is also breaking all of the tests that rely on it's data.
